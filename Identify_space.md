## **4) Greenfield Opportunities (Niche Segments to Start a Company)**

**Healthcare**
- **Opportunity:** AI for **specialty clinics** (dermatology, ophthalmology, PT) with niche terminology.
- **Why green:** Many vendors focus on hospitals; specialty clinics are underserved.

**Compliance**
- **Opportunity:** **Industry-specific compliance** (e.g., SOC 2 for healthtech, HIPAA automation for SMBs).
- **Why green:** Current tools are generic and too expensive for smaller teams.

**Finance Ops**
- **Opportunity:** **AI reconciliation + anomaly detection** for SMB accounting.
- **Why green:** Most SMB tools are manual and fragmented.

**B2B Support**
- **Opportunity:** AI agents for **vertical SaaS support** (construction, logistics, staffing).
- **Why green:** Industry-specific knowledge is the differentiator; generic bots fail.

**Legal Ops**
- **Opportunity:** **Contract review for niche industries** (pharma, oil & gas, energy).
- **Why green:** Domain-specific clauses are high value and poorly automated.

**Procurement**
- **Opportunity:** **Vendor risk AI** for mid-market procurement.
- **Why green:** Large enterprise tools are heavyweight and expensive.

**Industrial Ops**
- **Opportunity:** **Predictive maintenance insights** for small factories.
- **Why green:** AI adoption is low; data exists but unused.

**HR & Talent**
- **Opportunity:** **AI role-specific hiring** for skilled trades or healthcare.
- **Why green:** Most HR AI focuses on tech hiring, not trade roles.

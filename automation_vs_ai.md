# Automation vs. AI-Driven Automation

Businesses often say they want “automation,” but there are two very different approaches: rule-based automation and AI-driven automation. Both can reduce manual work, but they solve different kinds of problems.

## Rule-Based Automation
Rule-based automation follows predefined logic. It works best when the steps are clear, consistent, and predictable.

**How it works**
- You define rules like: “If the invoice total is under $5,000, approve it automatically.”
- The system executes exactly those rules every time.

**Best for**
- Repetitive, structured tasks
- Stable processes with clear conditions
- Compliance-driven workflows

**Examples**
- Route support tickets based on category and priority.
- Send payment reminders 3 days before an invoice due date.
- Trigger a purchase order approval if spend exceeds a threshold.

## AI-Driven Automation
AI-driven automation uses machine learning or language models to handle tasks that are variable, messy, or hard to express as simple rules.

**How it works**
- The system learns patterns from data (e.g., past approvals or classifications).
- It can interpret unstructured inputs like emails or PDFs.
- It produces probabilistic outputs (with confidence scores), not guaranteed results.

**Best for**
- Unstructured or ambiguous inputs
- Tasks that require interpretation or judgment
- Processes that evolve over time

**Examples**
- Extract line items from invoices in multiple formats.
- Classify customer emails by intent and urgency.
- Suggest next-best actions for sales reps based on CRM history.

## Key Differences at a Glance

| Aspect | Rule-Based Automation | AI-Driven Automation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Logic | Fixed if/then rules | Learned patterns and models |
| Inputs | Structured data | Structured + unstructured data |
| Outcomes | Deterministic | Probabilistic |
| Maintenance | Update rules manually | Retrain models or adjust prompts |
| Best use | Stable, repetitive tasks | Variable, complex tasks |

## Choosing the Right Approach
A common pattern is to start with rule-based automation for predictable steps, then add AI-driven automation where human judgment or messy data is involved. Many workflows use both:
- Rules handle routing and validation.
- AI handles interpretation, extraction, or recommendations.

By matching the tool to the task, organizations can scale operations while keeping quality and control.
